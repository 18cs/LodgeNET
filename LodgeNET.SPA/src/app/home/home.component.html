                    You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized use only.

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for purposes including, but not limited
                        to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct
                        (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.</li>

                    <li>Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine monitoring,
                        interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose.</li>
